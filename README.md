# LFC-Analysis

This is a personal analysis into Liverpool Football Club (LFC). The 2022-23 has, thus far, been a poor one for Liverpool, struggling in the Premier League following a season where they won a domestic cup double, played in the Champions League Final, and came second in the Premier League. There have been many conversations into what exactly has caused the change in fortunes moving from the previous season into this one.

I've begun with an analysis of Liverpool's right back, Trent Alexander Arnold, both because I find him to be an interesting footballer (Liverpool play in an interesting way using him as a primary creator), and because he has been much maligned this season. 

For now, I only have a .rmd file, but a further write up will be coming as soon as I have finished my analysis.
